UPDATE posts
set content="<p>
	CSTHub is now live and ready to be used.
</p>
<p>
	As the first release there are some areas of the site which wont be open to public yet.
	However in the mean time the homework checklist and forums are operational.
</p>
<p>
	We ask for the moment that only CST students in sets 1A, 1B and 1C sign up for the site.
	We will be opening the site to all CST students soon.
</p>
<p>	
	We hope that you can find our site useful.
	Please give any feedback or suggestions to us either in person or to our email <a href=\"mailto:csthub@gmail.com\">csthub@gmail.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you,<br />
	<br />
	CSTHub Crew - David, Kevin, Troy, Jay and Jake.
